1.1 Background of the Study  
In many institutions, both public and private, managing assets and consumables remains a 
persistent challenge. A common issue is the absence of a clear system to track the availability, 
usage, condition, or loss of items. This lack of proper management often leads to confusion, poor 
decision-making, and inefficient use of resources. 
Key organizational assets—such as laptops, desktops, printers, projectors, and smart screens—
 are valuable and essential for daily operations. However, without a reliable tracking mechanism, 
it is difficult to monitor who is using what, when it was taken, or whether it is still functional. 
This can result in misplaced or damaged property, especially when employees are not held 
accountable for the items in their possession. 
Consumables, including markers, soap, water, and detergents, are also prone to mismanagement. 
These items are used frequently but may run out unnoticed due to the lack of a tracking system. 
This problem is critical in institutions like schools, offices, and hospitals, which depend on these 
consumables for smooth operation. 
Additionally, poor communication and lack of visibility into available resources mean that some 
items may remain unused, while others are unnecessarily reordered—leading to waste and 
overspending. These issues highlight the need for transparency and proper auditing of 
organizational property. 
To address these challenges, we propose a web-based system designed to manage and track both 
assets and consumables in real time. The system will display item availability, usage status 
(working, damaged, or in use), and allow users to make requests. It will also generate reports to 
support better management and decision-making. 
This solution will enhance accountability, simplify audits, prevent misuse, and improve resource 
transparency. Ultimately, it offers a modern and efficient approach to managing organizational 
assets and consumables, leading to reduced waste, cost savings, and increased productivity. 
1.2 Statement of the Problem 
In today’s public institutions and large organizations, poor tracking and management of assets 
and consumables has become a major issue. Laptops, projectors, and printers are often lost, 
misused, or unaccounted for due to the absence of proper record-keeping. Consumables like 
water, soap, and cleaning supplies are wasted or expire unnoticed, resulting in unnecessary 
expenses and low productivity. The core of the problem lies in the lack of a centralized, 
transparent system that can provide real-time data on what resources are available, who is using 
them, and where they are located. 
1 
This leads to confusion, resource duplication, inefficient service delivery, and ultimately poor 
decision-making. Moreover, it makes audits unreliable and opens the door to fraud or hidden 
information. If this challenge remains unresolved, organizations will continue to face increased 
costs, poor accountability, and weakened performance. More importantly, it will hinder national 
development efforts aligned with Rwanda’s Vision 2050, NST1, and global goals like the SDGs 
and AU Agenda 2063. 
To address this, there is a critical need for a web-based system that enables real-time asset and 
consumable management. Such a solution would promote transparency, prevent misuse, reduce 
waste, and empower managers to make informed decisions for better organizational outcomes. 
1.3 Research Objectives 
General Objective: 
The main purpose of this research is to develop a web-based system that enables organizations to 
efficiently manage, track, and monitor their assets and consumables. This system will improve 
transparency, accountability, and decision-making by providing real-time data on available 
resources, their usage, and maintenance status. 
Specific Objectives: 
1. Develop a user-friendly web application 
o Create a responsive system using Laravel and MySQL that allows users to log in,

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 Introduction to Asset and Consumable Management 
The management of organizational assets and consumables is essential for effective resource 
allocation and operational efficiency. Organizations often struggle with manual tracking, leading 
to mismanagement, misuse, and wastage of resources. Effective tracking systems are key to 
improving accountability, resource utilization, and cost reduction. This section reviews existing 
literature on asset and consumable management systems, highlighting the advantages of using 
digital tools for real-time tracking, reporting, and auditing. 
2.2 Traditional Methods of Resource Management 
Many organizations, especially public institutions and small companies, still rely on manual or 
outdated systems to manage their assets and consumables. These methods involve paper-based 
inventories, spreadsheets, or simple software that lacks real-time updates. According to Smith 
(2018), manual tracking is prone to errors, inefficiencies, and delays in decision-making. The 
absence of real-time data limits managers’ ability to monitor resource usage accurately, resulting 
in waste, unaccounted resources, and loss (Jones & Martin, 2020). 
 Gap Identified: Traditional systems do not provide transparency or accountability, 
making it difficult to trace resource usage, and there is a lack of systems that integrate 
tracking, auditing, and reporting. 
2.3 Web-based Systems for Asset and Consumable Tracking 
Web-based systems have emerged as a solution for improving asset and consumable 
management in organizations. These systems allow real-time tracking, updating, and reporting, 
making resource management more efficient. As noted by Lee et al. (2019), web-based systems 
offer centralized access to asset information, enabling better resource planning, usage 
monitoring, and timely maintenance. For example, systems like Asset Panda and Trackforce 
4 
have demonstrated improvements in reducing resource wastage and increasing accountability 
(Doe, 2021). 
 Gap Identified: While these systems exist, there is limited research on the specific needs 
of organizations in Rwanda, and the local context must be considered when 
implementing such systems. 
2.4 Benefits of Real-time Tracking and Auditing Systems 
Real-time tracking and auditing features play a crucial role in enhancing accountability and 
minimizing fraud. According to Kumar & Singh (2020), a key advantage of web-based systems 
is the ability to track resource usage in real time. This functionality ensures that employees are 
aware of available resources, and managers can easily identify who is using what, and when. 
Such systems also streamline the auditing process, making it easier to generate reports on the 
status, condition, and location of resources, as discussed by Zhang & Liu (2018). 
 Gap Identified: Existing literature primarily focuses on the technical benefits of these 
systems, but there is limited discussion on the human factors (user behavior, training) that 
affect the successful implementation of asset tracking systems. 
2.5 System Design and Usability Considerations 
The design and usability of asset tracking systems are vital for user adoption and success. A 
study by O'Connor (2022) emphasizes that an intuitive, user-friendly interface can significantly 
improve user engagement and reduce errors. System design should prioritize simplicity, making 
it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. Additionally, mobile 
compatibility is increasingly important, as it allows staff to access the system from anywhere 
within the organization (Roberts, 2019). 
 Gap Identified: While there are various asset tracking systems available, few offer 
comprehensive systems that include mobile access, a straightforward user interface, and 
customized features for different types of organizations, particularly those in developing 
countries. 
2.6 Challenges in Implementing Asset Management Systems 
The implementation of web-based asset management systems is not without challenges. 
According to Martin & Walker (2020), common barriers include high initial costs, resistance to 
change from employees, and the complexity of integrating with existing systems. In Rwanda and 
similar regions, internet connectivity issues and lack of local expertise can also pose significant 
challenges. Despite these obstacles, the long-term benefits of efficient asset management 
outweigh the challenges (Benson & Lister, 2019). 
5 
 Gap Identified: There is a lack of research on overcoming these specific implementation 
challenges in Rwanda, and there is a need for solutions tailored to the local infrastructure 
and organizational needs. 
2.7 The Need for a Comprehensive Resource Management System in Rwanda 
In the context of Rwanda, there is limited literature on the development of local solutions for 
resource management in organizations. As Rwanda’s economy grows, there is a rising need for 
more efficient, transparent management of organizational resources. With the rise of the digital 
economy, organizations are increasingly looking for ways to leverage technology to improve 
resource management, reduce waste, and enhance accountability. This project aims to fill this 
gap by developing a web-based system specifically designed for Rwandan organizations. 
 Gap Identified: Local solutions for asset and consumable management in Rwanda are 
scarce, and existing systems do not fully address the needs of Rwandan institutions and 
businesses. 
2.8 Conclusion 
This literature review highlights the challenges faced by organizations in managing assets and 
consumables, particularly in manual systems. It also identifies the potential of web-based 
systems to provide real-time tracking, auditing, and reporting, improving accountability and 
resource management. However, gaps in the local application of such systems in Rwanda need to 
be addressed, and this research aims to fill that gap by developing a tailored web-based solution 
that will meet the specific needs of local institutions.
